For each bath that is run, Isabelle needs 10ml of bubble bath. Tom provides 500 towels for each customer. If every room is filled to maximum capacity, how much bubble bath, in millilitres, does Isabelle need?",

Calculate the total number of tickets issued in the first 15 days.\n2. Subtract that from the total goal of 200 tickets to find out how many tickets are left to issue.\n3. Calculate the number of days remaining in the month (May has 31 days, so 31 - 15 = 16 days).\n4.
