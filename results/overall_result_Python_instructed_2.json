Then, she pours the remainder into the 6-liter bucket. How much more water, in liters, can she put into the 6-liter bucket, without overflowing?",
        "original_response": "To solve the problem, we start by considering how much water Hamza pours into the 3-liter and 6-liter buckets. \n\n1. Hamza fills the 5-liter bucket completely.\n2. She pours water from the 5-liter bucket into the 3-liter bucket until the 3-liter bucket is full. \n3. The 3-liter bucket can hold 3 liters, so she pours 3 liters into it, leaving her with 2 liters in the 5-liter bucket (5 - 3 = 2).\n4. She then pours the remaining 2 liters into the 6-liter bucket.\n\nNow, we need to determine how much more water the 6-liter bucket can hold. Since the 6-liter bucket is currently holding 2 liters, the remaining capacity is:\n\n6 liters (total capacity) - 2 liters (current amount) = 4 liters.\n\nThus, Hamza can put 4 more liters of water into the 6-liter bucket without overflowing.\n\nThe answer is 4 liters.",
