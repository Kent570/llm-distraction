        "new_response": "Let's define the current ages of Jessica and Claire.\n\n1. Let \\( C \\) be Claire's current age.\n2. Since Jessica is six years older than Claire, we can express Jessica's age as \\( J = C + 6 \\).\n\nFrom the information given, we know that in two years, Claire will be 20 years old. Therefore:\n\n\\[\nC + 2 = 20\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides, we find:\n\n\\[\nC = 18\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( C \\) back into the equation for Jessica's age:\n\n\\[\nJ = C + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24\n\\]\n\nNext, we will check the condition regarding Claire's father's age 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, Claire's age was:\n\n\\[\nC - 20 = 18 - 20 = -2 \\quad \\text{(This means Claire was not born yet)}\n\\]\n\nHowever, since the problem states that her father's age was 5 times Jessica's age back then, we need to find Jessica's age 20 years ago:\n\n\\[\nJ - 20 = 24 - 20 = 4\n\\]\n\nLet \\( F \\) be the father's age 20 years ago. According to the problem:\n\n\\[\nF = 5 \\times (J - 20) = 5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nNow, Claire's father is currently:\n\n\\[\nF + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that all the relationships hold true. The current ages are:\n\n- Claire's current age \\( C = 18 \\)\n- Jessica's current age \\( J = 24 \\)\n\nThus, Jessica is currently **24 years old**.",
