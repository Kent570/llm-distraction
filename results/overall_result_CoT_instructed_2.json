        "original_response": "To find the average weight of Janele's cats, we first need to calculate the total weight of all the cats and then divide that total by the number of cats.\n\n1. **Weights of the cats**:\n   - Cat 1: 12 pounds\n   - Cat 2: 12 pounds\n   - Cat 3: 14.7 pounds\n   - Cat 4: 9.3 pounds\n\n2. **Calculate the total weight**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 12 + 12 + 14.7 + 9.3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 12 + 12 = 24\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 24 + 14.7 = 38.7\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 38.7 + 9.3 = 48\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the average weight**:\n   Since Janele has 4 cats, we divide the total weight by 4:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average weight} = \\frac{\\text{Total weight}}{4} = \\frac{48}{4} = 12\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the average weight of Janele's cats is **12 pounds**.",

        "new_response": "To calculate the average weight of Janele's cats, we first need to find the total weight of all her cats.\n\n1. The weight of the first cat is 12 pounds.\n2. The weight of the second cat is also 12 pounds.\n3. The weight of the third cat is 14.7 pounds.\n4. The weight of the fourth cat is 9.3 pounds.\n\nNow, we can add up all these weights:\n\n- Total weight = 12 + 12 + 14.7 + 9.3\n\nCalculating this step-by-step:\n\n- 12 + 12 = 24\n- 24 + 14.7 = 38.7\n- 38.7 + 9.3 = 48\n\nSo, the total weight of all the cats is 48 pounds.\n\nNext, to find the average weight, we divide the total weight by the number of cats:\n\n- Average weight = Total weight / Number of cats = 48 pounds / 4 cats = 12 pounds per cat.\n\nTherefore, the average weight of Janele's cats is **12 pounds**.",
