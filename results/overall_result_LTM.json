Since there are 30 pieces of popcorn in each serving, we divide the total pieces by the number of pieces per serving:\n\n4. **Calculating servings**:\n   - Total servings needed = Total popcorn pieces / Pieces per serving\n   - Total servings needed = 270 pieces / 30 pieces per serving = 9 servings.\n\nThus, Jared should order **9 servings** of popcorn for all of them.",

        "new_response": "To determine how many tickets need to be sold, let's first analyze the information provided.\n\n1. **Jude's Tickets**: Jude sold 16 tickets.\n\n2. **Andrea's Tickets**: Andrea sold twice as many tickets as Jude.

Therefore:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sandra's Tickets} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{Jude's Tickets} + 4 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12\n   \\]\n\nNext, we can sum up all the tickets sold by Andrea, Jude, and Sandra:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Tickets Sold} = \\text{Jude's Tickets} + \\text{Andrea's Tickets} + \\text{Sandra's Tickets}\n\\]\nSubstituting the values we found:\n\\[\n\\text{Total Tickets Sold} = 16 + 32 + 12 = 60\n\\]\n\nNow, since there are 100 tickets in total, we can find out how many tickets still need to be sold:\n\\[\n\\text{Tickets Remaining} = \\text{Total Tickets} - \\text{Total Tickets Sold} = 100 - 60 = 40\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of tickets that need to be sold is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]",
