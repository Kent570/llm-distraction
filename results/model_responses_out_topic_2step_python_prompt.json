        "original_response": "Certainly! Here's a simple Python program to calculate Lucy's bank balance after her deposit and withdrawal:\n\n```python\n# Initial bank balance\ninitial_balance = 65\n\n# Deposit and withdrawal amounts\ndeposit = 15\nwithdrawal = 4\n\n# Calculate the new balance\nnew_balance = initial_balance + deposit - withdrawal\n\n# Output the new balance\nprint(\"Lucy\u2019s bank balance is:\", new_balance)\n```\n\nIf you run this program, it will give you Lucy's bank balance. The final balance would be $76.",
