        "original_response": "First, we need to calculate how many tickets Officer Hopps has given out in the first 15 days. He averages 8 tickets a day, so:\n\n\\( 15 \\text{ days} \\times 8 \\text{ tickets/day} = 120 \\text{ tickets} \\)\n\nNext, we need to find out how many tickets he has left to distribute to reach his goal of 200 tickets:\n\n\\( 200 \\text{ tickets} - 120 \\text{ tickets} = 80 \\text{ tickets} \\)\n\nNow, there are 31 days in May, so after the first 15 days, there are:\n\n\\( 31 \\text{ days} - 15 \\text{ days} = 16 \\text{ days} \\)\n\nTo find out how many tickets he needs to average each day for the remaining 16 days, we divide the remaining tickets by the number of days left:\n\n\\( \\frac{80 \\text{ tickets}}{16 \\text{ days}} = 5 \\text{ tickets/day} \\)\n\nThus, Officer Hopps has to average 5 tickets each day for the rest of the month to reach his required goal.",

        "new_response": "First, we need to calculate how many tickets Officer Hopps has given out in the first 15 days of May. If he averages 8 tickets a day for those 15 days, we multiply:\n\n8 tickets/day \u00d7 15 days = 120 tickets.\n\nNow, we know he needs to give out a total of 200 tickets in May. To find out how many more tickets he needs to give out after the first 15 days, we subtract the tickets already given out from the total required:\n\n200 tickets - 120 tickets = 80 tickets.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many days are left in May after the first 15 days. May has 31 days, so:\n\n31 days - 15 days = 16 days remaining.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many tickets he needs to average per day over the remaining 16 days to reach his goal of 200 tickets. We divide the remaining tickets by the remaining days:\n\n80 tickets \u00f7 16 days = 5 tickets/day.\n\nThus, Officer Hopps has to average 5 tickets a day for the rest of the month to reach his required goal.",

        "original_response": "First, we need to calculate how many tickets Officer Hopps has already given out in the first 15 days. If he averages 8 tickets a day for those 15 days, we can find the total tickets issued as follows:\n\nTotal tickets in the first 15 days = 8 tickets/day * 15 days = 120 tickets.\n\nNext, we determine how many tickets he still needs to issue to reach his goal of 200 tickets:\n\nTickets remaining = Total goal - Tickets issued = 200 tickets - 120 tickets = 80 tickets.\n\nNow, we calculate how many days are left in the month after the first 15 days. May has 31 days, so:\n\nDays remaining = 31 days - 15 days = 16 days.\n\nTo find out how many tickets Officer Hopps needs to average each day for the remaining 16 days, we divide the remaining tickets by the number of days left:\n\nAverage tickets per day = Tickets remaining / Days remaining = 80 tickets / 16 days = 5 tickets/day.\n\nTherefore, Officer Hopps has to average 5 tickets a day for the rest of the month to reach his required goal.",

The total number of fish in the aquarium is the sum of orange, green, and blue fish:\n   \\[\n   O + G + B = 80\n   \\]\n\nSubstituting the known values for \\( O \\) and \\( B \\):\n\\[\n25 + G + 40 = 80\n\\]\nSimplifying this:\n\\[\nG + 65 = 80\n\\]\n\\[\nG = 80 - 65 = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of green fish in the aquarium is 15.",

He planned to cook 3 burgers for each guest and had invited 10 friends over.  1 of his friends didn't eat meat and said they would bring their own food.

The burger buns come 8 to a pack. To find out how many packs of buns Alex needs, we divide the total number of buns by the number of buns per pack: \n\n24 buns \u00f7 8 buns per pack = 3 packs.\n\nThus, Alex needs to buy 3 packs of buns.",
