How many beads does Kylie use in total to make her jewelry?",
        "original_response": "First, we calculate the total number of beads used for each type of jewelry Kylie makes.\n\n1. **Necklaces**: Kylie makes 10 necklaces on Monday and 2 necklaces on Tuesday.\n   - Total necklaces = 10 + 2 = 12 necklaces.\n   - Each necklace requires 20 beads, so the total beads for necklaces = 12 x 20 = 240 beads.\n\n2. **Bracelets**: Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets on Wednesday.\n   - Each bracelet requires 10 beads, so the total beads for bracelets = 5 x 10 = 50 beads.\n\n3. **Earrings**: Kylie makes 7 beaded earrings on Wednesday.\n   - Each earring requires 5 beads, so the total beads for earrings = 7 x 5 = 35 beads.\n\nNow, we add up all the beads used:\n- Total beads = beads for necklaces + beads for bracelets + beads for earrings\n- Total beads = 240 + 50 + 35 = 325 beads.\n\nTherefore, Kylie uses a total of **325 beads** to make her jewelry.",

        "original_response": "Uncle Jude baked 256 cookies and gave 15 cookies to Tim. Then, he gave twice as many cookies as he gave to Tim to Anna, which means he gave 15 \u00d7 2 = 30 cookies to Anna. So far, he has given away 15 + 30 = 45 cookies. \n\nNow, we subtract the total number of cookies he gave away from the total he baked: 256 - 45 = 211. \n\nTherefore, Uncle Jude put 211 cookies in the fridge.",

        "new_response": "Uncle Jude baked a total of 256 cookies. He gave 15 cookies to Tim and 23 cookies to Mike. The total number of cookies given away to Tim and Mike is:\n\n15 (to Tim) + 23 (to Mike) = 38 cookies.\n\nTherefore, the number of cookies remaining after giving some to Tim and Mike is:\n\n256 (total cookies) - 38 (given away) = 218 cookies.\n\nAccording to the problem, Uncle Jude gave twice as many cookies to Anna as he gave to Tim. Since he gave 15 cookies to Tim, he gave:\n\n2 * 15 = 30 cookies to Anna.\n\nNow, we can find out how many cookies were kept in the fridge. The number of cookies given away to Anna and the total given away to Tim and Mike is:\n\n38 (to Tim and Mike) + 30 (to Anna) = 68 cookies.\n\nFinally, we can find out how many cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge by subtracting the total given away from the total baked:\n\n256 (total cookies) - 68 (given away) = 188 cookies.\n\nThus, Uncle Jude put 188 cookies in the fridge.",

        "original_response": "Helga tried on 7 pairs of shoes at the first store. At the second store, she tried on 2 more pairs than at the first store, which means she tried on \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) pairs of shoes.

Since she tried on 16 pairs at the first and second stores and 0 at the third store, the total pairs she tried on at the first three stores is 16.

He has 4 bags of nails to load, each of which weighs 5kg; he has 12 bags of hammers, each of which weighs 5 kg; he also has 10 bags of wooden planks, each of which weighs 30kg and can be sub-divided. He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?",
        "original_response": "First, we need to calculate the total weight of the items Daryl has:\n\n1. **Bags of nails**: \n   - 4 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 20 kg\n\n2. **Bags of hammers**: \n   - 12 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 60 kg\n\n3. **Bags of wooden planks**: \n   - 10 bags \u00d7 30 kg/bag = 300 kg\n\nNext, we add these weights together to find the total weight of all the items:\n\n- Total weight = Weight of nails + Weight of hammers + Weight of planks\n- Total weight = 20 kg + 60 kg + 300 kg = 380 kg\n\nNow we need to determine the total capacity of the crates Daryl has:\n\n- Each crate can hold up to 20 kg, and he has 15 crates.\n- Total capacity = 15 crates \u00d7 20 kg/crate = 300 kg\n\nNow, we compare the total weight of the items (380 kg) with the total capacity of the crates (300 kg):\n\n- The amount Daryl needs to leave out = Total weight of items - Total capacity of crates\n- Amount to leave out = 380 kg - 300 kg = 80 kg\n\nTherefore, Daryl is going to have to leave out 80 kg of items from the crates.",

        "original_question": "Jim had 365 trading cards. He gives 8 sets of cards to his brother, 5 sets of cards to his sister, and 2 sets of cards to his friend. How many cards did he give away, assuming 1 set has 13 trading cards?",
        "original_response": "Jim gives away sets of cards as follows: \n\n- To his brother: 8 sets \n- To his sister: 5 sets \n- To his friend: 2 sets \n\nFirst, we need to calculate the total number of sets given away:\n\nTotal sets = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 sets\n\nNext, we know that each set contains 13 trading cards. Therefore, the total number of cards given away can be calculated by multiplying the number of sets by the number of cards per set:\n\nTotal cards given away = 15 sets \u00d7 13 cards/set = 195 cards\n\nSo, Jim gave away a total of 195 trading cards.",
