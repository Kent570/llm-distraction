        "new_response": "To calculate the total weight of the carrots harvested by Kelly, we first need to find the total number of carrots she harvested from all three beds and then convert that number into pounds.\n\n1. **Total Carrots**:\n   - First Bed: 55 carrots\n   - Second Bed: 101 carrots\n   - Third Bed: 78 carrots\n\n   Total Carrots = 55 + 101 + 78 = 234 carrots\n\n2. **Weight Calculation**:\n   - Since 6 carrots weigh 1 pound, we can calculate the total weight in pounds using the following formula:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Weight (pounds)} = \\frac{\\text{Total Carrots}}{6}\n   \\]",
