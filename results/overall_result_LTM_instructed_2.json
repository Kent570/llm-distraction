        "original_response": "To find out how many balls Julia bought in total, we first need to calculate the total number of packs she bought for each color of ball and then multiply that by the number of balls in each pack.\n\n1. Calculate the total number of packs:\n   - Red balls: 3 packs\n   - Yellow balls: 10 packs\n   - Green balls: 8 packs\n\n   Total packs = 3 + 10 + 8 = 21 packs\n\n2. Each pack contains 19 balls. Now, we multiply the total number of packs by the number of balls in each pack:\n\n   Total balls = Total packs \u00d7 Balls per pack\n   Total balls = 21 packs \u00d7 19 balls/pack = 399 balls\n\nTherefore, Julia bought a total of **399 balls**.",
