Unfortunately, Buffy stole some of Carla's apples on the school bus, and 26 apples fell out of a hole on the bottom. So at lunchtime, Carla only had 8 apples remaining. How many apples did Buffy steal from Carla?",
        "original_response": "To find out how many apples Buffy stole from Carla, we can set up the equation based on the information provided.\n\n1. Carla starts with 79 apples.\n2. 26 apples fell out of her backpack.\n3. After losing some apples to Buffy and the ones that fell out, Carla ended up with 8 apples.\n\nWe can represent the number of apples stolen by Buffy as \\( x \\). The equation will be:\n\n\\[ 79 - 26 - x = 8 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( x \\):\n\n1. Calculate how many apples Carla had left before accounting for the stolen ones:\n   \\[ 79 - 26 = 53 \\]\n\n2. Now, set up the equation:\n   \\[ 53 - x = 8 \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[ x = 53 - 8 \\]\n   \\[ x = 45 \\]\n\nSo, Buffy stole 45 apples from Carla.\n\nTo summarize in a Python-like syntax:\n\n```python\ninitial_apples = 79\nfallen_apples = 26\nremaining_apples = 8\n\nstolen_apples = initial_apples - fallen_apples - remaining_apples\nprint(stolen_apples)  # Output will be 45\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Buffy stole 45 apples from Carla.",

According to the problem, he gave twice as many cookies to Anna as he gave to Tim: \\( A = 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\).\n6. Now we can calculate the total number of cookies given away:\n   - Total cookies given away = cookies to Tim + cookies to Mike + cookies to Anna\n   - Total given = \\( 15 + 23 + 30 = 68 \\).\n7. Finally, we can find out how many cookies he put in the fridge by subtracting the total given away from the total baked:\n   - Cookies in the fridge = total baked - total given\n   - Cookies in the fridge = \\( 256 - 68 = 188 \\).\n\nNow, we can write a simple Python program to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Constants\ntotal_cookies = 256\ncookies_tim = 15\ncookies_mike = 23\ncookies_anna = 2 * cookies_tim  # Anna gets twice what Tim got\n\n# Total cookies given away\ntotal_given = cookies_tim + cookies_mike + cookies_anna\n\n# Cookies in the fridge\ncookies_in_fridge = total_cookies - total_given\n\nprint(f\"Uncle Jude put {cookies_in_fridge} cookies in the fridge.\")\n```\n\nWhen you run this program, it will output: Uncle Jude put 188 cookies in the fridge.",

        "new_response": "First, let's calculate how much weight Ajax will lose after exercising for 2 hours every day for 2 weeks.\n\n1. **Weight loss per hour:** Ajax loses 1.5 pounds per hour.\n2. **Total exercise hours in 2 weeks:** \n   - 2 hours per day for 14 days (2 weeks) = 2 * 14 = 28 hours.\n3. **Total weight loss:** \n   - Weight loss = 28 hours * 1.5 pounds/hour = 42 pounds.\n\nNow we will subtract this weight loss from Ajax's initial weight:\n\n1. **Initial weight:** 80 kilograms.\n2. **Convert kilograms to pounds:** \n   - 80 kg * 2.2 pounds/kg = 176 pounds.\n3. **Final weight after loss:** \n   - Final weight = Initial weight - Weight loss = 176 pounds - 42 pounds = 134 pounds.\n\nThus, if Ajax exercises for 2 hours every day for two weeks, he will weigh 134 pounds.",
