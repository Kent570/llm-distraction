        "original_question": "Daryl is loading crates at a warehouse and wants to make sure that they are not overloaded. Each crate can weigh up to 20kg and he has 15 crates he can fill. He has 4 bags of nails to load, each of which weighs 5kg; he has 12 bags of hammers, each of which weighs 5 kg; he also has 10 bags of wooden planks, each of which weighs 30kg and can be sub-divided. He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?",
        "original_response": "First, let's calculate the total weight of all the items Daryl has:\n\n1. **Weight of the bags of nails:**\n   - He has 4 bags of nails, each weighing 5 kg.\n   - Total weight of nails = 4 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 20 kg.\n\n2. **Weight of the bags of hammers:**\n   - He has 12 bags of hammers, each weighing 5 kg.\n   - Total weight of hammers = 12 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 60 kg.\n\n3. **Weight of the bags of wooden planks:**\n   - He has 10 bags of wooden planks, each weighing 30 kg.\n   - Total weight of wooden planks = 10 bags \u00d7 30 kg/bag = 300 kg.\n\nNow let's sum up the total weight of all the items:\n\n- Total weight = Weight of nails + Weight of hammers + Weight of wooden planks\n- Total weight = 20 kg + 60 kg + 300 kg = 380 kg.\n\nNext, we need to determine the maximum weight Daryl can load into the crates:\n\n- Each crate can hold up to 20 kg, and he has 15 crates.\n- Maximum weight capacity = 15 crates \u00d7 20 kg/crate = 300 kg.\n\nNow, let's find out how much weight Daryl needs to leave out:\n\n- Excess weight = Total weight - Maximum weight capacity\n- Excess weight = 380 kg - 300 kg = 80 kg.\n\nThus, Daryl will have to leave out 80 kg of items from the crates.",

He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. The weight of Emma is 1000 pounds. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?",
        "new_response": "First, let's convert Emma's weight from pounds to kilograms. Since 1 pound is approximately 0.453592 kg, we can calculate:\n\n1000 pounds * 0.453592 kg/pound \u2248 453.592 kg.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total weight of the items Daryl has:\n\n1. **Bags of Nails**: \n   - 4 bags, each weighing 5 kg: \n   - Total weight = 4 * 5 kg = 20 kg.\n\n2. **Bags of Hammers**: \n   - 12 bags, each weighing 5 kg: \n   - Total weight = 12 * 5 kg = 60 kg.\n\n3. **Bags of Wooden Planks**: \n   - 10 bags, each weighing 30 kg (but can be subdivided): \n   - Total weight = 10 * 30 kg = 300 kg.\n\nNow, let\u2019s sum all these weights:\n\nTotal weight of items = Weight of nails + Weight of hammers + Weight of wooden planks\n= 20 kg + 60 kg + 300 kg = 380 kg.\n\nNext, we need to determine how much weight Daryl can load into the crates. Each crate can hold up to 20 kg, and he has 15 crates:\n\nMaximum weight Daryl can load = 15 crates * 20 kg/crate = 300 kg.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much weight exceeds the capacity of the crates:\n\nWeight to leave out = Total weight of items - Maximum weight Daryl can load\n= 380 kg - 300 kg = 80 kg.\n\nTherefore, Daryl is going to have to leave out **80 kg** of items from the crates.",

        "original_response": "First, we need to calculate how many hours the cobbler works from Monday to Thursday. \n\n- He works 8 hours each day for 4 days: \n  \\( 8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 32 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\nNext, we calculate his working hours on Friday. \n\n- On Friday, he works from 8am to 11am, which is:\n  \\( 11 \\text{ am} - 8 \\text{ am} = 3 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\nNow, we can find the total hours worked in the week:\n\n- Total hours from Monday to Thursday:\n  \\( 32 \\text{ hours} \\)\n\n- Plus the hours on Friday:\n  \\( 32 \\text{ hours} + 3 \\text{ hours} = 35 \\text{ hours} \\).\n\nThe cobbler can mend 3 pairs of shoes in one hour. Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes he can mend in 35 hours is:\n\n- Total pairs of shoes mended:\n  \\( 35 \\text{ hours} \\times 3 \\text{ pairs/hour} = 105 \\text{ pairs} \\).\n\nThus, the cobbler can mend a total of **105 pairs of shoes in a week**.",

        "original_question": "Bob has to hire someone to fix his garden.  A storm destroyed all 20 of his rose bushes.  He decides to replant all the rose bushes.  Each rose bush costs $150.  He also needs to pay a gardener $30 an hour, 5 hours each day for 4 days.  The final expense is 100 cubic feet of soil sold for $5 per cubic foot.  How much did the entire gardening project cost?",
        "original_response": "First, we calculate the cost of the rose bushes. Bob needs to replant 20 rose bushes, and each costs $150. Therefore, the total cost for the rose bushes is:\n\n\\[ \n20 \\text{ bushes} \\times 150 \\text{ dollars/bush} = 3000 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the cost of the gardener. The gardener charges $30 per hour and works for 5 hours each day for 4 days. So, the total cost for the gardener is:\n\n\\[ \n30 \\text{ dollars/hour} \\times 5 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 4 \\text{ days} = 600 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\nNow, we find the cost of the soil. Bob needs 100 cubic feet of soil, and it costs $5 per cubic foot. Therefore, the total cost for the soil is:\n\n\\[ \n100 \\text{ cubic feet} \\times 5 \\text{ dollars/cubic foot} = 500 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\nNow, we add all the costs together to find the total expense for the gardening project:\n\n\\[ \n3000 \\text{ dollars} + 600 \\text{ dollars} + 500 \\text{ dollars} = 4100 \\text{ dollars} \n\\]\n\nThus, the entire gardening project cost $4100.",

Then Kylie makes 5 beaded bracelets and 7 beaded earrings on Wednesday. 20 beads are needed to make one beaded necklace. 10 beads are needed to make one beaded bracelet. 5 beads are needed to make one beaded earring. How many beads does Kylie use in total to make her jewelry?",
        "original_response": "First, we calculate the total number of necklaces Kylie makes:\n\n- On Monday, she makes 10 necklaces.\n- On Tuesday, she makes 2 necklaces.\n\nSo, the total number of necklaces is:\n10 + 2 = 12 necklaces.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of beads used for the necklaces. Since each necklace requires 20 beads, the total number of beads for the necklaces is:\n12 necklaces * 20 beads/necklace = 240 beads.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of bracelets made by Kylie on Wednesday:\n\n- She makes 5 beaded bracelets.\n\nFor the bracelets, since each bracelet requires 10 beads, the total number of beads for the bracelets is:\n5 bracelets * 10 beads/bracelet = 50 beads.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of earrings made by Kylie on Wednesday:\n\n- She makes 7 beaded earrings.\n\nEach earring requires 5 beads, so the total number of beads for the earrings is:\n7 earrings * 5 beads/earring = 35 beads.\n\nNow, we add all the beads together to find the total number of beads used:\n\n- Beads for necklaces: 240 beads\n- Beads for bracelets: 50 beads\n- Beads for earrings: 35 beads\n\nTotal beads used = 240 + 50 + 35 = 325 beads.\n\nTherefore, Kylie uses a total of 325 beads to make her jewelry.",

        "new_response": "First, we calculate the total number of beaded necklaces Kylie makes. On Monday, she makes 10 necklaces, and on Tuesday, she makes 2 necklaces. So, the total number of necklaces is:\n\n\\[ \n10 + 2 = 12 \n\\]\n\nNext, we find out how many beads are used for the necklaces. Since each beaded necklace requires 20 beads, the total number of beads for the necklaces is:\n\n\\[ \n12 \\text{ necklaces} \\times 20 \\text{ beads per necklace} = 240 \\text{ beads} \n\\]\n\nNow, we calculate the number of beaded bracelets Kylie makes on Wednesday, which is 5 bracelets.
