        "original_question": "Daryl is loading crates at a warehouse and wants to make sure that they are not overloaded. Each crate can weigh up to 20kg and he has 15 crates he can fill. He has 4 bags of nails to load, each of which weighs 5kg; he has 12 bags of hammers, each of which weighs 5 kg; he also has 10 bags of wooden planks, each of which weighs 30kg and can be sub-divided. He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?",
        "original_response": "First, let's calculate the total weight of the items Daryl wants to load:\n\n1. **Bags of nails**: \n   - 4 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 20 kg\n\n2. **Bags of hammers**: \n   - 12 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 60 kg\n\n3. **Bags of wooden planks**: \n   - 10 bags \u00d7 30 kg/bag = 300 kg\n\nNow, we can add up the total weight of all the items:\n\n- Total weight = Weight of nails + Weight of hammers + Weight of wooden planks\n- Total weight = 20 kg + 60 kg + 300 kg = 380 kg\n\nNext, let's determine the total weight capacity of the 15 crates:\n\n- Each crate can hold up to 20 kg.\n- Total capacity = 15 crates \u00d7 20 kg/crate = 300 kg\n\nNow, we need to figure out how much weight Daryl will have to leave out. Since he has a total weight of 380 kg and the crates can only hold 300 kg, we can calculate the excess weight:\n\n- Excess weight = Total weight - Total capacity\n- Excess weight = 380 kg - 300 kg = 80 kg\n\nTherefore, Daryl will have to leave out **80 kg** of items from the crates.",

He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. The weight of Daryl's neighbor is 2000 pounds. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?",
        "new_response": "First, we need to convert the weight of Daryl's neighbor from pounds to kilograms. There are approximately 0.453592 kilograms in a pound. Therefore, the weight of Daryl's neighbor in kilograms is:\n\n2000 pounds \u00d7 0.453592 kg/pound \u2248 907.185 kg\n\nNext, we calculate the total weight of the items Daryl has to load. \n\n1. **Bags of Nails:** \n   - 4 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 20 kg\n\n2. **Bags of Hammers:** \n   - 12 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 60 kg\n\n3. **Bags of Wooden Planks:** \n   - 10 bags \u00d7 30 kg/bag = 300 kg\n\nNow, we sum the weights of all items:\n\nTotal weight = Weight of nails + Weight of hammers + Weight of wooden planks\nTotal weight = 20 kg + 60 kg + 300 kg = 380 kg\n\nDaryl has 15 crates, and each crate can hold up to 20 kg. Therefore, the maximum total weight that can be loaded into the crates is:\n\nMaximum weight = Number of crates \u00d7 Weight per crate\nMaximum weight = 15 crates \u00d7 20 kg/crate = 300 kg\n\nNow, we need to determine how much weight Daryl has to leave out to meet the weight limit of the crates. \n\nTotal weight he has (380 kg) - Maximum weight allowed (300 kg) = Weight to leave out:\n\n380 kg - 300 kg = 80 kg\n\nThus, Daryl is going to have to leave out **80 kg** of items from the crates.",

        "original_response": "To find out how many desktop computers Mr. Lu sold, we first need to determine how many laptops and netbooks were sold.\n\n1.

One-third of the total sales are netbooks:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Netbooks} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 72 = 24\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we can calculate the number of desktop computers sold by subtracting the number of laptops and netbooks from the total sales:  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Desktop computers} = 72 - (\\text{Laptops} + \\text{Netbooks}) = 72 - (36 + 24) = 72 - 60 = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, Mr. Lu's store sold 12 desktop computers.",

The problem states that Sandra sold 4 more than half the number of tickets Jude sold:\n- Half of Jude's tickets = 16 / 2 = 8 tickets.\n- Therefore, Sandra's tickets = 8 + 4 = 12 tickets.\n\nNow we can sum up the tickets sold by each person:\n- Total tickets sold = Jude's tickets + Andrea's tickets + Sandra's tickets = 16 + 32 + 12 = 60 tickets.\n\nSince there are 100 tickets to be sold, we can find out how many more tickets need to be sold:\n- Tickets remaining = Total tickets - Tickets sold = 100 - 60 = 40 tickets.\n\nThus, the number of tickets that still need to be sold is 40.",

        "original_response": "First, we need to determine the total amount of water needed per hour for both Violet and her dog. \n\nViolet needs 800 ml of water per hour, and her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour. \n\nSo, the total water needed per hour is:\n\n800 ml (Violet) + 400 ml (Dog) = 1200 ml per hour.\n\nNow, Violet can carry 4.8 liters of water. We need to convert this to milliliters for consistency:\n\n4.8 L = 4800 ml.\n\nNext, we can find out how many hours they can hike by dividing the total amount of water by the total water consumption per hour:\n\n4800 ml \u00f7 1200 ml/hour = 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, Violet and her dog can spend 4 hours hiking.",

        "new_response": "First, we need to convert the amount of water Violet can carry from liters to milliliters. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, 4.8 liters is equal to:\n\n4.8 L \u00d7 1000 ml/L = 4800 ml.\n\nNext, we will determine the total water consumption per hour for both Violet and her dog. Violet drinks 800 ml of water per hour, and her dog drinks 400 ml per hour. Therefore, their combined water consumption per hour is:\n\n800 ml (Violet) + 400 ml (dog) = 1200 ml per hour.\n\nNow, to find out how many hours they can hike before running out of water, we divide the total amount of water they can carry by their total consumption per hour:\n\n4800 ml (total water) \u00f7 1200 ml/hour = 4 hours.\n\nThus, Violet and her dog can spend hiking for a total of 4 hours.",

He realizes that he has too much to load and will have to leave some items out of the crates to meet the weight limit. Emma weighs 1000 kilograms. In kg, how much is Daryl going to have to leave out of the crates?",
        "new_response": "First, let's calculate the total weight of the items Daryl has:\n\n1. **Bags of nails**: \n   - 4 bags, each weighing 5 kg.\n   - Total weight = 4 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 20 kg.\n\n2. **Bags of hammers**: \n   - 12 bags, each weighing 5 kg.\n   - Total weight = 12 bags \u00d7 5 kg/bag = 60 kg.\n\n3. **Bags of wooden planks**: \n   - 10 bags, each weighing 30 kg.\n   - Total weight = 10 bags \u00d7 30 kg/bag = 300 kg.\n\nNow, let's sum up the total weight of all items:\n\n- Total weight of items = Weight of nails + Weight of hammers + Weight of wooden planks\n- Total weight of items = 20 kg + 60 kg + 300 kg = 380 kg.\n\nNext, we need to see how much weight Daryl can load into the crates. \n\nEach crate can hold up to 20 kg, and he has 15 crates:\n\n- Maximum weight Daryl can load = 15 crates \u00d7 20 kg/crate = 300 kg.\n\nNow we determine how much weight he needs to leave out:\n\n- Total weight of items = 380 kg.\n- Maximum weight he can load = 300 kg.\n\nThe weight that must be left out is:\n\n- Weight to leave out = Total weight - Maximum weight he can load\n- Weight to leave out = 380 kg - 300 kg = 80 kg.\n\nTherefore, Daryl is going to have to leave out 80 kg of items from the crates.",
