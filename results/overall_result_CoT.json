At the third store, she did not try on any shoes, but she did buy a scarf.  But at the fourth store, she tried on twice as many pairs of shoes as she did at all three other stores combined, before finally choosing a pair to buy.  What is the total number of pairs of shoes Helga tried on before buying her new shoes?",
        "original_response": "First, we calculate the number of pairs of shoes Helga tried on at each store:\n\n1. At the first store, she tried on **7 pairs** of shoes.\n2. At the second store, she tried on **2 more pairs** than at the first store, which is \\(7 + 2 = 9\\) pairs.\n3. At the third store, she did not try on any shoes, so that is **0 pairs**.\n4. At the fourth store, she tried on **twice as many pairs** as she did at all three other stores combined. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of pairs tried on at the first three stores:\n\\[\n7 + 9 + 0 = 16 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\nAt the fourth store, she tried on twice that amount:\n\\[\n2 \\times 16 = 32 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find the total number of pairs she tried on before buying her new shoes by adding up the pairs from all four stores:\n\\[\n7 + 9 + 0 + 32 = 48 \\text{ pairs}\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pairs of shoes Helga tried on before buying her new shoes is **48**.",

Therefore, she tried on:\n2 * 16 = 32 pairs at the fourth store.\n\nNow we can sum all the pairs of shoes Helga tried on:\n16 (from the first three stores) + 32 (from the fourth store) = 48 pairs.\n\nThus, the total number of pairs of shoes Helga tried on before buying her new shoes is 48.",

        "original_response": "On Monday, Natalia rode 40 kilometers. On Tuesday, she rode 50 kilometers. \n\nOn Wednesday, she rode 50% fewer kilometers than on Tuesday.

The sum of the kilometers from Monday (40 kilometers) and Wednesday (25 kilometers) is:\n\n40 kilometers + 25 kilometers = 65 kilometers.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total kilometers Natalia rode over the four days:\n\n- Monday: 40 kilometers\n- Tuesday: 50 kilometers\n- Wednesday: 25 kilometers\n- Thursday: 65 kilometers\n\nAdding these together:\n\n40 + 50 + 25 + 65 = 180 kilometers.\n\nTherefore, Natalia rode a total of 180 kilometers.",

Ajax's current weight is 80 kilograms. To convert this to pounds:\n   \\[\n   80 \\, \\text{kilograms} \\times 2.2 \\, \\text{pounds/kilogram} = 176 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\n5. Finally, we subtract the weight lost from his current weight:\n   \\[\n   176 \\, \\text{pounds} - 42 \\, \\text{pounds} = 134 \\, \\text{pounds}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, if Ajax exercises for 2 hours every day for two weeks, he will weigh 134 pounds.",
