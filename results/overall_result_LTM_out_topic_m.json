        "new_response": "To find out how many bananas are in basket E, we first need to determine the total number of fruits in all five baskets. Given that the average number of fruits per basket is 25 and there are five baskets, we can calculate the total number of fruits as follows:\n\nTotal fruits = Average fruits per basket \u00d7 Number of baskets = 25 \u00d7 5 = 125 fruits.\n\nNow, we know the contents of the other baskets:\n- Basket A: 15 apples\n- Basket B: 30 mangoes\n- Basket C: 20 peaches\n- Basket D: 25 pears\n\nLet's add up the fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D:\n\n15 (apples) + 30 (mangoes) + 20 (peaches) + 25 (pears) = 90 fruits.\n\nNow, we can find out how many fruits are in basket E by subtracting the total fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D from the total number of fruits:\n\nFruits in basket E = Total fruits - Fruits in baskets A, B, C, and D\nFruits in basket E = 125 - 90 = 35 fruits.\n\nSince basket E contains bananas and Mary bought 30 tomatoes, the number of bananas in basket E doesn't change because the tomatoes are not part of the basket count. \n\nTherefore, basket E contains **35 bananas**.",

Dewei picked up 2 pounds less than Daliah, which means Dewei picked up:\n\n17.5 pounds - 2 pounds = 15.5 pounds.\n\nZane picked up 4 times as many pounds of garbage as Dewei.

        "original_response": "On Monday, Natalia rode 40 kilometers. \n\nOn Tuesday, she rode 50 kilometers.\n\nOn Wednesday, she rode 50% fewer kilometers than the day before (Tuesday). To find out how many kilometers she rode on Wednesday, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Kilometers on Wednesday} = 50 - (0.5 \\times 50) = 50 - 25 = 25 \\text{ kilometers} \n\\]\n\nOn Thursday, she rode as many kilometers as the sum of the kilometers from Monday and Wednesday:\n\n\\[ \n\\text{Kilometers on Thursday} = 40 + 25 = 65 \\text{ kilometers} \n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the total kilometers ridden over the four days:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total kilometers} = 40 + 50 + 25 + 65 = 180 \\text{ kilometers} \n\\]\n\nThus, Natalia rode a total of 180 kilometers.",
