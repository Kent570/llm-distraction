        "original_response": "Jim gives away trading cards in sets. He gives 8 sets to his brother, 5 sets to his sister, and 2 sets to his friend. First, we need to calculate the total number of sets he gave away:\n\nTotal sets = 8 (brother) + 5 (sister) + 2 (friend) = 15 sets.\n\nNext, since each set contains 13 trading cards, we calculate the total number of cards given away:\n\nTotal cards given away = 15 sets \u00d7 13 cards/set = 195 cards.\n\nTherefore, Jim gave away 195 trading cards.",
